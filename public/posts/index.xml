          I thought that it would be a good idea to perhaps journal some of my time in Switzerland and the change in my career trajectory and goals for the future. As such, this will be the first in a multiple series of journal entries for my time at the università della svizzera italiana (USI) studying for a Master&amp;rsquo;s in finance here and my reflections and thoughts on my time here.

          1.0 Introduction In this article we will prove that Gravity Co. Ltd. (“The Company” or “Gravity”) is over-valued at the current trading price of $190. Considering that we do not anticipate subscription revenue or royalties and fees to increase substantially the valuation of Gravity depends almost exclusively on the growth of the mobile game revenue streams.
The process of proving future outcomes is difficult, we believe by approaching the valuation with epistemological uncertainty in mind (Tannert, 2007) and providing a structured framework a sufficient conclusion can be reached.
